# Burgers for Everyone

# Fat-Burger
Built on node and sequelize, secured by dotenv, hosted on heroku. This open menu application allows you to submit whatever food you'd like to order to the menu. When you're ready to eat, click on the item to update its status to the devoured column! While the application is simple, this heroku web-app uses sequelize as the ORM.
